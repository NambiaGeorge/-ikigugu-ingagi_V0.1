Smart School Lab Manager - IoT Device Control Dashboard A web-based dashboard for managing and monitoring devices in school labs, aimed at optimizing power usage, ensuring security, and improving device management. 
Hi everyone our today's task are as follow: 
Project: Smart School Lab Manager – IoT Lab
Sprint Phase: Week 1 – Planning & Setup
Focus Today: Define system flow (UI wireframes + use cases)
🟦 SOFTWARE ENGINEERING (SWE)
🎯 Goal: Define how the system will work and what users will see/do.
Tasks:
•	🎨 UI Wireframes:
o	Sketch basic screens: login page, teacher dashboard, student view, device control page.
o	Tools: Figma / draw.io / paper sketch + photo
•	🧩 Use Case Drafting:
o	Define 3–5 key user actions (e.g., “Teacher logs in and shuts down all PCs”)
o	Format: Short scenario text or use case diagram
Deliverables:
•	1–2 wireframe drafts
•	Use case doc or image
•	Update GitHub with /design folder and add sketches

🟨 NETWORK ENGINEERING (NWE)
🎯 Goal: Plan how devices will be connected inside the lab.
Tasks:
•	🕸️ Topology Mapping:
o	Create a simple network layout: switches, router, server, devices
o	Use draw.io or pen + paper
•	🔌 Connectivity Planning:
o	Write down how the dashboard will communicate with IoT devices (e.g., MQTT over LAN)
o	Consider internet needs (e.g., local vs. cloud control)
Deliverables:
•	Topology diagram
•	Connectivity note/plan
•	Add to /network-design on GitHub

🟧 INDUSTRIAL IT (IIT)
🎯 Goal: Prepare for how we’ll control hardware devices (real or simulated).
Tasks:
•	🔍 Hardware Inventory:
o	List all lab devices we want to control (PCs, projectors, fans, lights, etc.)
o	Add columns for control method: smart plug, relay, or simulation
•	🛠️ Simulation Plan:
o	Decide what hardware (Arduino, Raspberry Pi, or software mocks) will simulate IoT behavior
Deliverables:
•	Hardware list spreadsheet
•	Simulation approach doc
•	Add to /hardware-plans on GitHub
