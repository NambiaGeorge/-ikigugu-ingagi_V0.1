Here are some of the issues I faced while working on this project: 
1. Technical Issues
Issue: Lack of Hardware for Simulations
Since I'm not aware of exactly what devices we're using implementing and testing simulations (e.g., relays for fans, smart plugs for PCs) is difficult, especially for Week 3 tasks like device/API simulations (May 27).

Recommendation: I'd like a detailed report of all the materials we're using.

2. Lack of Schedule
Issue: No schedules
Since there's no organisation of who should be specifically working on what, I find myself at a loss on what exactly I should be doing.

Recommendation: Create a schedule of who specifically is working on what so we can all collaborate with each other.

3. Lack of Communication
Issue: There's no communication
Since there hasn't been an update on deliverables since week 1 I have no idea who's working on what or if we're still working. Since we're collaborating with other teams communication should be more of a must

Recommendation: I suggest we have weekly meetings even if once a week.

Here are some of the things I have to complete: 
i)Assemble hardware componenets .
ii)Test simulations for device control and abuse detection (e.g., student exceeding PC usage).
iii)Document simulation setup and limitations.
