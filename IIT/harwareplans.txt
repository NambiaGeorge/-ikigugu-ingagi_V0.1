# Smart School Lab - Hardware Plans
## Overview
This folder contains IIT deliverables for hardware integration and simulations.

## Hardware Inventory
- File: `hardware_inventory_may13.xlsx`
- Lists devices (PCs, fans, lights) with control methods (smart plugs, relays).

## Simulation Approach
- File: `simulation_approach_may13.md`
- Uses Arduino (relays), Raspberry Pi (smart plugs), Node-RED (mocks).

## Simulation Setup
- **Arduino**: Connect 5V relay module to pin 7. Use MQTT topic `smartlab/fan1`.
- **Raspberry Pi**: Run Mosquitto broker and Python scripts for PC simulation.
- **Node-RED**: Deploy flows for virtual device responses.

## Limitations
- Simulations lack real power consumption data.
- Full hardware integration planned for Week 3.
