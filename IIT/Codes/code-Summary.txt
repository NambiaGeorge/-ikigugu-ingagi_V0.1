All the codes here are subject to change since they are not the final draft on what hardware and how the project will work. 
Here's a summary of what the codes do: 
  
prototype.py (Python Script)
Purpose: Simulates smart plug-controlled devices (e.g., PCs, projectors) for the IoT dashboard.
Functionality:
Connects to an MQTT broker (broker.hivemq.com) to receive commands (e.g., “on”/“off”) on topics like smartlab/pc1/control.
Simulates two devices (PC1, Projector1), updating their states and publishing status to smartlab/<device>/status.
Supports group commands (e.g., “all off” on smartlab/all/control).
Logs actions (e.g., “PC1 ON at 2025-05-27T13:00”) to device_logs.json for analytics.
Use Case: Tests teacher controls (e.g., shutting down PCs) and usage logging.
Remote Use: Runs on your laptop, no hardware needed. Upload to /hardware-plans for the May 27 demo.
  
  
abuseDetection.json (Node-RED Flow)
Purpose: Simulates student actions and detects device misuse (e.g., a PC staying on past a schedule).
Functionality:
Listens for PC1 commands on smartlab/pc1/control via MQTT.
Simulates overuse by checking if PC1 is “on” after a scheduled time (e.g., 5 PM).
Triggers a notification on smartlab/pc1/abuse if misuse is detected (e.g., “PC1 on after 17:00”).
Logs abuse events to abuse_logs.json.
Use Case: Tests the project’s abuse detection feature for student activity monitoring.
Remote Use: Runs in Node-RED’s browser-based editor. Upload to /hardware-plans for May 27/28 testing.

  
prototype.ino (Arduino Code)
Purpose: Simulates a relay-controlled device (e.g., a fan or light) for the IoT dashboard.
Functionality:
Connects to an MQTT broker (broker.hivemq.com) and subscribes to smartlab/fan1/control.
Toggles a virtual relay (simulated as an LED on pin 7) for “on”/“off” commands.
Publishes state to smartlab/fan1/status.
Includes a basic time-based schedule (e.g., auto-off every minute for demo).
Use Case: Tests teacher controls (e.g., turning off fans) and time-based schedules.
Remote Use: Simulate in Tinkercad Circuits (Arduino + LED) or document for on-site team testing. Upload to /hardware-plans.
